I originally saw this in the movie 21. 

Basically you have 3 doors to chose from, one containing a million dollars and the other two containing nothing.

Once you select what door you want to open, the game show host opens one of the other doors to show that nothing is behind it.

He then asks if you want to change your selection, is it in your best interest to do so?

Initially I assumed that changing your selection would not increase/decrease your odds of winning.

Turns out if you swap your % of winning goes up to 66%, whereas if you do not it remains at the original probability of 33%.

Here's a little script that proves that :)
